# New Drawing Animation Logic

## Overview
The drawing animation system has been completely rewritten to be simpler, more reliable, and ensure perfect correspondence between golden flashes and prize counts.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Sequential Prize Drawing**
- **Old Logic**: Complex parallel animations with timing issues
- **New Logic**: Simple sequential drawing - one prize at a time
- Each prize gets exactly one golden flash animation
- Perfect 1:1 correspondence between animations and prizes

### 2. **Simplified Flow**
```
1. Button Click → Initialize drawing state
2. Get predetermined results (preset or random)
3. Sequential animation: For each prize in results:
   a. Roll through blocks (8-15 rolls)
   b. Stop on correct prize block
   c. Show golden flash
   d. Update counters immediately
   e. Mini celebration effect
4. Complete drawing → Massive celebration
```

### 3. **Reliable Counting**
- **Problem**: Complex real-time counter logic with race conditions
- **Solution**: Direct 1:1 mapping between golden flash and counter update
- No more timing delays or missed counts
- Each `updatePrizeCounter()` call corresponds to exactly one golden flash

### 4. **Fair Block Distribution**
- **$50 prizes**: Distributed evenly across 6 blocks using usage tracking
- **$100 prizes**: Alternates between 2 blocks
- **$500 prize**: Always uses the single block
- No more random clustering on same blocks

### 5. **Clean State Management**
```javascript
// Clear initialization
this.prizeCounts = {}; // Current draw counts
this.ticketsDrawnCount = 0; // Total tickets processed
this.totalWinnings = 0; // Running total
this.actualResults = []; // Predetermined prize list
```

## Code Structure

### Main Methods
1. **`startBulkDraw()`** - Entry point, initializes everything
2. **`initializeDrawingState()`** - Sets up counters and gets results
3. **`animateSequentialPrizes()`** - Main animation loop
4. **`rollForPrize()`** - Individual prize animation
5. **`updatePrizeCounter()`** - Updates displays after each prize
6. **`completeDrawing()`** - Final celebration and cleanup

### Removed Complexity
- ❌ Multiple parallel animations
- ❌ Complex timing calculations
- ❌ Race condition-prone real-time counters
- ❌ Confusing delay-based counter updates
- ❌ Multiple animation layers

### Added Reliability
- ✅ One animation per prize (guaranteed)
- ✅ Immediate counter updates after golden flash
- ✅ Predictable animation timing
- ✅ Clean state management
- ✅ Fair block distribution

## Usage

The system automatically uses preset results if available, or generates random results. Each golden flash corresponds to exactly one prize from the predetermined results list.

**Example Flow for 25 tickets:**
1. Get preset: 18x $50, 6x $100, 1x $500
2. Shuffle order: [$50, $100, $50, $500, $50, ...]
3. Animate each prize sequentially
4. Each golden flash updates the exact counter
5. Final celebration shows perfect totals

## Benefits

- **Reliability**: No more counting errors or timing issues
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and debug
- **Performance**: Less complex animations, better performance
- **Accuracy**: Perfect correspondence between visuals and results
- **Fairness**: Even distribution across available blocks
